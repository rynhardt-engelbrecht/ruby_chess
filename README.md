# Ruby Chess

Welcome to my Command-line Chess Game! Built completely with Ruby.
(This project is part of the Ruby Course from The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project))

My game follows classic [chess rules](https://musketeerchess.net/p/games/classic/rules/rules.php)

  To play the game, you will be prompted to enter the coordinates of a piece you want to move. Then,
  to enter the coordinates of the square you want to move your selected piece to.

  During the game, you can also enter 'q', 'quit', or 'exit'. When asked to make a move,
  to quit the game. You will then be prompted to type 'y' or 'n' to save your game to allow
  you to load it again later.

  You can also type 'back' after selecting a piece to move, in case you change your mind.

  I still plan to add a 'Computer' player and to write tests for every component.
